Important information:

    This bot is only for educational purposes.

    Make sure to put the pre trained data from "PretrainedDivinationYoloData" in your output folder if you want to test the functions.

    The pre tained data is not ment to be used to create a bot. You will need to train your own data which fits your needs.

    The bot itself can run in background, but keep in mind to detect object the client need to render. That means do not drag the window out of the display neither minimize or hide it. Nevertheless you will still be able to use your computer and run multiple bots on one machine, depending on your CPU.

Features:

    Clicking any postion using the User32 SendMessage method

    Same with Keystrokes

    Reading players coordinates and players divination experience from memory (This may be updated along with game updates)

    Poor player travelling to a location, based on player coordinates

    Clicking any game object with a specific confidence

Keep in mind that this is a quick and dirty project and I will only update if I have the time to do so and feel like doing it. If you got any questions hit me up!
